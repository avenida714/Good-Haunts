### Technical Details ###
* Creating and deleting Hauntlists proved to be a particularly tricky issue for us, as our goal was to have a user edit and delete Hauntlists dynamically without the need to refresh the page. In reference to checkboxes, we struggled to find a way to change a parent list item in the presence of a child checked box. The CSS selector :has, which can target parent elements of children, is only supported by Safari. Thus we had to come up with a more creative solution: storing a querySelectorAll in a variable to iterate through all li elements, removing those links with a checked box using .contains() and .remove().
```
    //remove all lis with a checked check box

    const list = document.querySelectorAll("li");
    const checked = document.querySelectorAll(":checked");

        list.forEach(li => {
          checked.forEach(checked => {
            if(li.contains(checked)) li.remove()

          })
        })



```
* Another issue we encountered with deleting Haunt Lists was the difficulty of deleting a cookie server side. The typical method of setting its expiration date to some time in the past was not working for us. Instead, we had to use the alternative method of setting the cookieâ€™s original max age to -1.
```
const logoutUser = (req, res) => {
  delete req.session.auth;
  req.session.cookie.originalMaxAge = -1;
};
